# Typing Pattern Analyzer - Claude Memory

## Project Overview
A comprehensive Python-based typing pattern analyzer for macOS that performs deep analysis of typing behavior, efficiency patterns, and keyboard usage habits. Production-ready tool with sophisticated data collection and behavioral insights.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Microsecond-precision keystroke capture** with comprehensive timing analysis
- **macOS accessibility integration** using NSWorkspace and pynput
- **Real-time cognitive load calculation** based on typing patterns and context
- **Advanced behavioral analysis**: hesitation detection, flow states, finger usage
- **Multi-format reporting**: Interactive HTML, JSON data export, CSV for research
- **Comprehensive CLI interface** with bash launcher script

## Data Structure
Each keystroke event captures:
- Microsecond timestamp precision
- Key identification and character mapping
- Dwell time and inter-keystroke intervals
- Application context (NSWorkspace integration)
- Behavioral indicators (corrections, pauses, bursts)
- Finger assignments and cognitive load metrics
- Enhanced error tracking (correction_type, corrected_text, likely_typo, typo_pattern)

## Analysis Capabilities
1. **Key Usage Patterns**: Character/key frequency, error rates, correction analysis
2. **Enhanced Error Detection**: Multi-keystroke correction sequences, typo pattern recognition, context-aware mistake detection
3. **Hesitation Detection**: Keys causing typing flow interruption, context-aware pauses
4. **Efficiency Metrics**: WPM calculation, typing consistency, flow state detection
5. **Finger Usage Analysis**: Load distribution, hand balance, same-finger bigrams
6. **Cognitive Load Assessment**: Context-aware mental processing indicators
7. **Behavioral Recognition**: Burst typing, rhythm analysis, productivity correlations
8. **Word & Phrase Analysis**: Frequency patterns, optimization opportunities, vocabulary analysis
9. **Correction Analytics**: Error-prone characters, app-specific error rates, correction efficiency

## Usage
**Quick Start:**
```bash
# 6 minutes (0.1 hours)
./typing-analyzer.sh 0.1

# 30 minutes
./typing-analyzer.sh 0.5

# 2 hours
./typing-analyzer.sh 2
```

**CLI Tools:**
```bash
# Manual keylogger
python3 src/keylogger.py --duration 1h

# Analysis only
python3 src/analyzer.py
```

## Recent Updates (Latest: HTML Report Formatting Fixed - July 25, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED: HTML Report Enhancements (July 25, 2025)
- **FIXED: Claude Analysis HTML Rendering**: Claude insights now render properly as formatted HTML content instead of raw markup tags
- **ADDED: Interactive Chart Visualizations**: HTML reports now include Chart.js-powered interactive graphs:
  - Character frequency bar chart with responsive design
